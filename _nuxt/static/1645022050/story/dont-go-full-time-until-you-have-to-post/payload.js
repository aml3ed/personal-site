By keeping their day job, these founders are seen as less committed, established and serious. Full-time founders, on the other hand - regardless of the traction they have in their business - are seen as brave, head-strong, and passionate. Being full-time is actually one of the major criteria for getting access to funding through grants and accelerator programs.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI think this is ridiculous. People need \u003Cstrong\u003Estability and security\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E to be their most creative***.*** Pressuring founders - especially college students - to go full-time on their business before they business needs them to is setting them up for unnecessary stress and pain. I know first hand.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI went straight into working full-time on Lumastic after I graduated college. I was told this was the right move because, “There would never be an easier time”. I didn’t have student loans thanks to my parents and grandparents. I didn’t have a wife and kids to support. And I had about $15k in the bank thanks to grants from pitch competitions.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, while I’m so grateful I was in this position, I wish I had not gone full-time after graduating. Why? Because \u003Cstrong\u003Ethe business didn’t need me to be\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E. We had no customers, no users, and hadn’t even launched the core product. In fact, I think by going full-time too early, it caused me to spend way too much time thinking and focusing on stuff that didn’t matter - especially when it came to our MVP.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause we were launching to no one and had nothing but time, \u003Cstrong\u003EI spent months doing the stupidest shit\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E like building our own goddamn UI library in React. Stuff that I would not have done if I was working part-time and really had to prioritize what I was doing to reach our goals. I’m a big believer in Parkinson’s Law that, “Work expands to the time allotted”. And when you go full-time too early - you have too much time.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EGoing full-time too early also starts to create problems when the money (and time) start to run out. The last 6 months I was full-time with Lumastic, I was nothing but a ball of stress, doubt, and frustration. Nothing was working, I was incredibly worried about my financial situation, and I was having regular panic attacks whenever a new problem presented itself. Imagine not only running, but growing a startup being in that state of mind. The reality is, you can’t.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, what would I do next time? I’d do what literally \u003Cstrong\u003Eevery creator\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E does while they’re building their business. I’d get a part-time or flexible full-time job and work a few hours in the mornings and evenings until the business \u003Cem\u003Erequires\u003C\u002Fem\u003E more hours every day than I can give. I’d set reasonable expectations, and focus on making consistent progress on the stuff that matters until it’s clear that going full-time would lead to \u003Cstrong\u003Esignificant growth in\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003Erevenue\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is hard for startup founders to comprehend I think because of the epidemic that is easy access to capital. However, opportunities to raise money or get grants by being full-time doesn’t pay the bills. And I promise going full-time just because it was “easy” ended up being so much more painful than useful. Ignore the pressure - focus on making the work fun. Keep the side-hustle a side-hustle for as long as you can.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},featuredImage:{url:"https:\u002F\u002Fmedia.graphcms.com\u002FwCLwx05lRpKlMZayGcgr"},author:{id:"ckvh1xueoedsg0b86nqfrztdd",bio:"I'm a designer and software engineer who likes to make stuff on the internet.
