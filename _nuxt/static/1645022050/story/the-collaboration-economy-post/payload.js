This new economic engine was born out of the shared societal trauma of World War I that left us with a desire for abundance and a fear of scarcity. The name of the game was optimizing the means of production.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, after World War II, companies got so good at optimizing production that they were out-producing market demand. So, to deal with this problem, the ‚Äúconsumer economy‚Äú was born. Abundance was no longer our core desire. In the consumer economy, we desired status and feared inferiority. The department with the biggest budget was now marketing and advertising. The name of the game was optimizing the means of consumption.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThen, in 2008, after decades of propaganda designed to keep people ‚Äòkeeping up with the Joneses‚Äô and believing that ‚Äúgreed is good‚Äù, the consumer economy collapsed with the housing market. We reached a point of overconsumption and were due for a market shift. Saffo theorizes that this new economic era is the ‚Äúcreator economy‚Äú.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe talks about how the wealth of information provided by the internet has created a scarcity of attention, and now individuals online can gain status by creating things that attract this new scarce commodity. He talks about how television and mass media will be dominated by personal media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. He says that the name of the game is now optimizing the means of creation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe wrote all of this before Instagram even launched, so it‚Äôs kind of crazy how much he got right. However, I don‚Äôt believe the creator economy is our next economic era. I also don‚Äôt believe we are in Lawrence Lessig‚Äôs sharing economy or Tina Brown‚Äôs gig economy.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EI believe we are at the beginning of the collaboration economy.\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe creator, sharing, and gig economy are one in the same. Their most prominent platforms touch very different industries: YouTube operates in advertising, Airbnb in housing, and Uber in transportation. However, they all share the same business structure.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESee, the internet‚Äôs biggest companies aren‚Äôt individual companies at all.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EThey are massive collaborations between them and their users.\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u003Cp\u003ELet‚Äôs take Uber as an easy example that‚Äôs been talked about a lot. Uber is a company that pays people to drive other people around. However, drivers on Uber are not employees - they are a distributed workforce of over a quarter-million ‚Äúindependent contractors‚Äù. Uber is a company built by collaborating with a quarter-million small-businesses.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, let‚Äôs take a less obvious example: YouTube. YouTube is the entertainment destination of the internet with 5 billion videos watched every single day. But YouTube isn‚Äôt a production company, they‚Äôre a cable company. The endless supply of entertainment is created by millions of independent filmmakers, artists and entertainers. They make content for YouTube and get a cut of the revenue YouTube makes from running ads against their work. And YouTube makes more than $15 billion dollars a year from that partnership.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese collaborative relationships between independent businesses are the through-theme of our new economic era. And these tech companies represent our first shot at supporting this incredibly powerful, exciting, and new class of entrepreneur and small-business owner.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EAnd we need to do way better.\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EOn all of these platforms, their collaborators, the people who do the work to keep them valuable, are getting the short end of the deal. Imagine if you ran a business and your landlord, rather than charging you rent, told you they‚Äôre taking 25%-50% of your revenue every month. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening right now for hundreds of thousands of small businesses across the world. It‚Äôs predatory.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd the reason these platforms - these internet real-estate companies - can do it is because developing the software - the land - is complicated and expensive, and they have the capital to acquire their competitors and remain monopolies.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EThat being said, I believe there is hope for the collaboration economy.\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese tech companies are the product of its first inning. Their reckoning comes when we start remembering the promise of the internet. Right now, we‚Äôre collaborating with many-to-one relationships; YouTube to its creators, Uber to its drivers, Airbnb to its hosts. However, unlike the communications technology before it, the power of the internet is it‚Äôs ability to connect many-to-many.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIn the coming years of the collaboration economy, I believe spaces we connect on the internet will be owned by us. I believe that we will treat them more like countries and less like companies. I believe we‚Äôll create internet communication standards that make it easy for us to own and move our digital property between platforms. I believe that thanks to the open-source and no-code movements, software development will become so accessible that creating internet-real-estate will be a weekend project.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI also believe that governments will realize that in a world where being an independent business is more common than working for a company, we need state-run healthcare and universal basic income.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI believe that the collaboration economy is our greatest shot at a democratically run economy where individuals wield the power once held by corporations.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EI believe this because if this shift doesn‚Äôt happen, we‚Äôre fucked.\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI am in love with the collaboration economy. So much so that we‚Äôve staked our entire business here at Lumastic on supporting its growth.
