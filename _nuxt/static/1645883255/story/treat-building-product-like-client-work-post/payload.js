I liked the people I took projects from, but over the course of the work period I would get increasingly frustrated with them.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wanted to approach these projects like works of art - ways of showing off my skills and creativity. However, a lot of ideas I would present to clients for how I thought things should be designed, displayed, or developed would get shot down - leaving the final product a shell of what I thought it could have been. The client was happy - which should have made me happy, but all I was so focused on was the artistic vision that wasn’t realized.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFlash forward to building product at Lumastic, and that habit of prioritizing my artistic vision over the opinions of customers hadn’t been broken. And unlike clients, users of a startup don’t have the same power and control to direct development - especially if they aren’t paying you.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, this gave me full license to not only arrogantly believe all of my opinions were right, but to \u003Cstrong\u003Eactively not listen to or seek out user feedback\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E. Over the course of Lumastic’s lifetime, I think I did 60 user-interviews - only 4 of which were with creators who were running profitable businesses.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI masked this mistake by telling myself that, “I am our target customer” - as if that gave me license to speak for our entire customer segment. And that also wasn’t even true. I wasn’t running a profitable creative business nor had I gotten to that point when I ran my YouTube channel. I was the founder of a startup. I was not our users.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe wasted so much time building features that I thought were be cool and useful \u003Cstrong\u003Ewithout consulting anyone.\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E Ugh. It’s so painful to realize this mistake in hindsight because, “talk to your users” is the main mantra of startups.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, the next time around, I’m treating building product like client work. The clients job is to share what problems need solving - my job is to \u003Cstrong\u003Elisten and solve elegantly\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ENote: This is part of a larger blog series on \u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003Ca target='_blank' title=\"\u002Fstory\u002F10-things-i-learned-from-my-first-failed-startup-post\u002F\" href=\"\u002Fstory\u002F10-things-i-learned-from-my-first-failed-startup-post\u002F\"\u003E\u003Cem\u003E10 Things I Learned From My First Failed Startup\u003C\u002Fem\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003Cem\u003E.
