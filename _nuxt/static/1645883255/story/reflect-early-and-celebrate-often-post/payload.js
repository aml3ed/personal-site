And at that time, Keith and I were far more interested in going to sleep than cracking open champaign. Plus, Sarah and Chelsea had already left and gone to sleep.

I thought that would be such a moment of triumph that Iâ€™d want to mark my body with a reminder of that feeling forever. But when we made our first sale, it didnâ€™t feel anything like that. It felt mundane. I think when it happened, I sent an excited message in Slack, breathed a sigh of relief, and got back to work.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThese moments made me realize that \u003Cstrong\u003Ethe wins never feel as good as the losses feel bad.\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E When starting a business, your todo list is never ending. Thereâ€™s always another goal to hit, another waypoint, another mountain to climb. And the feelings of constant fear, inadequacy, and insecurity follow you throughout the journey. However, itâ€™s so important to find time to celebrate in-spite of these feelings and make the wins bigger than they feel.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EItâ€™s important to reflect on where the business needs be go. But you and your team also need to take time to sit back and see how far youâ€™ve come. You need to be your own advocate, champion, and coach and pat yourself on the back once in a while. So when youâ€™re putting out the fire-of-the-day, you remember that youâ€™ve conquered hard things before - and can do it again.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI wish, as a leader, I had taken more times to reflect and celebrate with our team. I wish we had woken everyone up and popped open that champagne at 2 am.
