BAMs were the only major meeting we had as a company. We’d sit, eat, and drink for about 4 hours while we reflected on our last week and set direction for the next. And at first glance, this week’s BAM seemed like any other. The familiarity and nostalgia felt so nice as we gathered around my co-founder’s dining room table once again, but it did nothing to ease my nerves.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBecause although I was walking into this conversation with notes on how we move forward with Lumastic - a part of me knew that we’d be leaving this conversation \u003Cem\u003Ewithout\u003C\u002Fem\u003E Lumastic.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EAnd 10 minutes after dinner...we did.\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt’s official. We’ve decided to shut down Lumastic - the project management platform for creators that I started nearly 4 years ago. Although this decision did not come lightly - it did come so much easier for me than I thought it would.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003E6 months ago, I was telling people I was, “Taking a break from Lumastic to settle into my new job”. But the truth is that I was experiencing severe burnout, depression, and a deep loss of identity. For months, I did not talk about Lumastic with really \u003Cem\u003Eanyone\u003C\u002Fem\u003E apart from my girlfriend, Sarah. In fact, when someone said the word, “Lumastic” to me, I’d get a visceral pain in my stomach as an intense shame bubbled up into my throat.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut today, with the help of Sarah, a great therapist, and a journal - I feel strong, grounded, and confident enough to say goodbye to Lumastic in the most fitting way possible - by sharing the core lessons I learned along this journey of inspiring others to share progress and not perfection.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI hope that by sharing my mistakes and failures, I can spare someone else the pain I experienced learning these lessons the hard way.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBelow you will find a quick TLDR; version of each main finding with links to posts that expand on the learnings as I write them.
