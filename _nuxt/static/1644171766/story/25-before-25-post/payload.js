I wrote it when I was 15 and forgot about it until just a couple years ago. And that&#39;s why I find it fascinating to see what I accomplished and what I didn&#39;t. It&#39;s really interesting to see how my values have changed and stayed the same over time by looking at what goals 15 year old me wanted to accomplish in his next decade and what present me throughout that decade actually decided to do. And to my surprise, there&#39;s actually a lot of crossover!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, in this blog post, I&#39;m going to go through all 25 items and tell the stories behind my 25 before 25.

It&#39;s a beautiful, rural village surrounded by 3 (or 4?) &quot;Hegaus&quot;. They are the equivalent of small mountains in the Shenandoah.

But I&#39;ve always been all about having new experiences. So, for my birthday right before Covid, my friends and I went skeet shooting and we all had a great time!
