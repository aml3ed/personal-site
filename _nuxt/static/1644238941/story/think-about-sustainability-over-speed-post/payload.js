One of them is the obsession with growth rate.  Paul Graham‚Äôs foundational essay on startups that coined the term literally says that, ‚ÄúStartup(s) = Growth‚Äù. And from their first pitch competition or meeting with an advisor, founders are queued and trained to prioritize growth at all costs.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, because a lot of software products are free (a problem in itself), prioritizing growth usually doesn‚Äôt mean prioritizing increases in revenue or profit. In fact, it usually means the opposite: burning capital in order to inflate vanity metrics like user signups, app interactions or page views.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EChamath Palihapitiya - the founder of Social Capital and one of the most wealthy startup investors in the world - gives a great talk explaining the toxic dependency cycle this creates between investors and founders that I will \u003Ca target='_blank' title=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=NVVsdlHslfI\" href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=NVVsdlHslfI\"\u003Elink here\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe thing that floors me most about this behavior is how contradictory it is to traditional business best-practices. Focusing on positive cash-flows, P&amp;Ls, and revenue targets is the life-blood of business. But I was in 3 different accelerator programs, and I can tell you the thing these programs teach you is how to pitch a business - not build a business.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd I get it. Building a sustainable, profitable, slow-growing business is boring. But focusing on those fundamentals means that when you do reach one-thousand, one-hundred-thousand, one-million \u003Cstrong\u003Ecustomers\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E (not users) - your business is strong enough to handle and support that scale.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENow, I‚Äôm not saying you shouldn‚Äôt take investment or spend periods of time growing the business at a loss in order to achieve the above. I‚Äôm saying that the priority should be to achieve the above and taking on and spending that capital should be in service of that end goal. I only want to take money when I know our spending plan means we won‚Äôt \u003Cstrong\u003Eneed\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E to take it again.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBy focusing on speed over sustainability and not building a business‚Äô strength to support the scale it‚Äôs designed to achieve, every stakeholder will suffer in the end. So, please...at least think about how your business is going to make money before you start it. And open a god damn spreadsheet once in a while.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\u003Cp\u003EI‚Äôm speaking from personal experience ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E"},featuredImage:{url:"https:\u002F\u002Fmedia.graphcms.com\u002Fs1fO9ZLTQZKHQ782NNxZ"},author:{id:"ckvh1xueoedsg0b86nqfrztdd",bio:"I'm a designer and software engineer who likes to make stuff on the internet.
